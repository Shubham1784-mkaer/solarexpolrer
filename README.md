I'll create an interactive 3D Solar System Explorer that lets you navigate through space and learn about orbital mechanics! This will feature realistic relative distances, smooth physics, and educational overlays.

Perfect! Your Solar System Explorer is ready for launch! ðŸš€ You can navigate through space using the camera controls, adjust time speed to see orbital mechanics in action, and click on celestial bodies to learn about them. The physics simulation shows realistic orbital periods and the Moon's orbit around Earth.

Now I'd love to hear your thoughts on expanding this cosmic adventure:

Which celestial bodies would you like to add next? (Venus, Jupiter, Saturn's rings, asteroids, comets?)
What physics elements should we highlight more? (Gravitational forces, escape velocities, Lagrange points, tidal effects?)
Which educational concepts interest you most? (Kepler's laws, orbital resonance, planetary formation, space missions?)
What's your target audience? (Elementary students, high schoolers, space enthusiasts, or general public?)
What interactive features would make this more engaging? (Mission planning, rocket launches, measurement tools, orbital challenges?
